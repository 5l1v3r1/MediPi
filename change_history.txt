MediPi_v1.0.3-PILOT-20160317-1
- bugfix for LHS button disable whilst transmitting in schedule mode
- Addition of keypad functionality - keypad appears at startup and will reappear at configurable periods of inactivity
n.b. hardcoded the keypad unlocking code so that any code will work until I have created the appropriate certs/jks 
commented out the automatic clear of the data when transmitted

MediPi_v1.0.4-PILOT-20160322-1
- Update to authorisation functionality to use the patient cert jks password to unlock the device
- Extracted out the Spine functionality from SpineTransmitter class. Renamed it to generic Transmitter class and extended it for Spine in preparation for the REST client interface.
- refactored how certain classes are cast and added isAssignableFrom() within an if statement rather than attempting a cast and catching the thrown attempt

MediPi_v1.0.5-PILOT-x
- updated MediPi class to contain a getter for the medipi properties Properties object and updated appropriate other classes to use it
- Updated the transmitted data in all the devices to remove patient identifiable entries, update all times with ISO8601 Zulu timestamps and rearranged the metadata. This required changes to all the device drivers including the python scripts updating. Updated some of the Utilities class dateformatter to take a timezone.
- updated Name for usb devices to have a colon between the make and model
- added :persist to the metadata tags for data to be persisted to the database after transmission
-updated the metadata:format to use the configurable dataseparator
- addition of iso8601time dataelement to questionnaire device
- Medipi version ident which was passed in the data has been reduce to just the version and version name
- MediPi now checks the device jks keystore using the MAC address of the host machine - this cert name is used to set a system property - the cert name is used for the Restful request
- The Keypad class sets a system property to be the patient cert name which is used for the Restful request
